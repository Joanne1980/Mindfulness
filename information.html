                    <p class="symptom">The symptoms of depression can be complex and vary widely between people. If
                        you're depressed,
                        you may feel
                        sad, hopeless and lose interest in things you used to enjoy.

                        The symptoms persist for weeks or months and are bad enough to interfere with your work, social
                        life and
                        family life.

                        There are many other symptoms of depression and you're unlikely to have all of those listed on
                        this page.

                    <p class="coping">Depression can often come on gradually, so it can be difficult to notice
                        something is
                        wrong. Many people try to cope with their symptoms without realising they're unwell. It
                        can sometimes take a friend or family member to suggest something is wrong.

                        Doctors describe depression in adults as either less severe (mild) or more severe
                        (moderate or severe), based on:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the symptoms, including how often you get symptoms and how bad they are</li>
                        <li>how long depression lasts</li>
                        <li>the impact on your daily life</li>

                        <li>A few people with severe depression may have symptoms of psychosis.
                            you'll usually be asked to answer a set of questions to help doctors assess how severe
                            your
                            condition is.</li>

                    <p>It can be difficult to distinguish between grief and depression. They share many of the same
                        characteristics, but there are important differences between them.

                        Grief is an entirely natural response to a loss, while depression is an illness.

                        People who are grieving may have symptoms of depression, but they usually improve with time.
                        For some people, bereavement can lead to depression.

                        If you're grieving it's normal to have feelings of sadness. Some other symptoms of
                        depression are rare with grief and bereavement, such as having suicidal thoughts, symptoms
                        of psychosis and feeling hopeless or guilt-ridden.</p>
